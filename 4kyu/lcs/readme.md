from Wikipedia:
The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences.
It differs from problems of finding common substrings: unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.

## Task
Write a function lcs that accepts two strings and returns their longest common subsequence as a string. Performance matters.

## Examples

```
lcs( "abcdef", "abc" ) => "abc"
lcs( "abcdef", "acf" ) => "acf"
lcs( "132535365", "123456789" ) => "12356"
lcs( "abcdefghijklmnopq", "apcdefghijklmnobq" ) => "acdefghijklmnoq"
```


## Testing


This is a performance version of xDranik's kata of the same name.
This kata, however, has much more full and heavy testing. Intermediate random tests have string arguments of 20 characters; hard random tests 40 characters; extreme 60 characters (characters are chosen out of 36 different ones).

The reference algorithm solves all (12 fixed, 72 intermediate, 24 hard, 12 extreme) tests within ~150ms. The example algorithm without memoisation would take ~15000ms.
