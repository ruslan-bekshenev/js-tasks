Laura Bassi was the first female professor at a European university.
Despite her immense intellect, she was not always allowed to lecture publicly.

One day a professor with very strong beliefs against women in academia sent some agents to find Bassi and end her career.

Help her escape by telling her the safest places in town!

Task
Implement the function advice(agents, n) where

agents is an array of agent coordinates.
n defines the size of the city that Bassi needs to hide in, in other words the side length of the square grid.
The function should return a list of coordinates that are the furthest away (by Manhattan distance) from all agents.

As an example, say you have a 6x6 map, and agents at locations

```
[[0, 0], [1, 5], [5, 1]]
```
